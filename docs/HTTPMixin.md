# HTTPMixin Class

The `HTTPMixin` class provides methods for making HTTP requests and handling responses.

## Methods

### `_make_request(self, method, url, headers, json_data=None, params=None)`

This method makes an HTTP request using the specified method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to the given URL with optional headers, JSON data, and parameters.

- `method`: The HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) for the request.
- `url`: The URL to send the request to.
- `headers`: The headers to include in the request.
- `json_data` (optional): JSON data to include in the request body.
- `params` (optional): Parameters to include in the request URL.

### `_handle_response(self, response)`

This method handles the HTTP response returned by the `_make_request` method.

- `response`: The HTTP response object returned by the request.

If the response has a valid JSON content type (`application/json`), it returns the parsed JSON response. Otherwise, it returns an error message and code indicating the issue with the response.

## Example Usage

```python
# Create an instance of HTTPMixin
http_mixin = HTTPMixin()

# Make a GET request
response = http_mixin._make_request('GET', 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/1', headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'})
print(response)
```

This example demonstrates how to create an instance of the `HTTPMixin` class and make a GET request to a sample API endpoint.
